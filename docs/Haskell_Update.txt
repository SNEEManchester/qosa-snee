This logs the status of the implementation of the Haskell translator.

May 7: This is still under developemnt and not in the live code.
See uk.ac.manchester.cs.diasmc.querycompiler.queryplan.testOperators.OperatorFactory
Currently Haskell code is in a seperate repository at
http://rpc240.cs.man.ac.uk:3180/svn/Haskell
Version 186 is stable (I hope) but there is no guarantee that all versions will be.
Before including Haskell a stable version of the Haskell code will be included in the SNEEql directory.

Three new settings may need to adjusted.
runhugs_file = C:/Program Files/WinHugs/runhugs.exe
haskell_main = C:\Haskell\SNEEqlTest.hs
haskell_decl_file = C:\Haskell\Declarations.txt

May 9: 
Concept of using Haskell has been offically approved.
Logical optimization to be done in Haskell
	-Placing selects as low as possibe
	-Building a left deep tree.
	
Optimizations to be done in Java
    - Pushing projects down
    - Combining operators
    - Removing unrequired operators	
	
LocalSettings created to hold directory names.
